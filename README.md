# Songle

Songle is a song guessing game (inspiration taken from LoLdle). First, the lyrics are shown. With every incorrect guess, one category of the song is revealed (Year, Genre, and Artist). You can skip the song if needed. Every correct guess will increment the score. This is a React project that uses Vite and npm. We all used Visual Studio Code. 

```
git clone https://github.com/Masonlin2104/UgaHacks.git

cd UgaHacks

npm run dev
```

Problems we ran into: We had trouble with styling issues but through trial and error and some debugging using ChatGPT we fixed them. We also had issues with implementing an API to generate the lyrics.
